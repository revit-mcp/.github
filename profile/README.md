### Project Components

The project consists of three main parts:

[**revit-mcp**](https://github.com/revit-mcp/revit-mcp): Connects with AI conversation clients. Responsible for providing executable functions to the AI conversation client and communicating with Revit.

[**revit-mcp-plugin**](https://github.com/revit-mcp/revit-mcp-plugin): This is a Revit plugin used to receive AI commands, load command sets, and execute specific functions.

[**revit-mcp-commandset**](https://github.com/revit-mcp/revit-mcp-commandset): Command sets are actual executable commands wrapped based on Revit external events. Developers can add functionality to the command set or customize their own work sets.
